## Pythononwheels.

the plain,simple and easy to use web generator framework for python.

### Based on reliable python 'standards' and frameworks

    * SQLAlchemy     ORM / DB Access
    * Beaker        Session Management
    * Mako        Template engine for Views
    * WSGI        Web Service
    * JQuery    Javascript 
    * Bootstrap    Twitter Layout Framwork 

### Key Features:

    * Model View Controller
    * Uses the well proven Ruby On Rails principles
    * Scaffolding
    * JQuery integration
    * Responsible Layout
    * Lightweight
    * Nose Tests
    
The clear Focus was to develop a Framework in between the existing Big Ones,
which have quite some learning curve to get started and
the small, very low level ones, which make it neccessary to develop
quite a lot yourself.
There are good examples of both in the python community and there are 
good reasons for those frameworks to exists as well, such as enterprise and up or 
fine grained tayloring at the bottom.

**PythonOnWheels' main objective is making you focus on your webapp
and not on the Framework**. Is therefore (hopefully)
    * working just as you nexpexct it
    * using the proven rails principles
        * convention over configuration
    * scaffolding (since it brings you directly to a running example)

Just give it a try.
